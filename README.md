[Identifying Chinese Opinion Expressions with Extremely-Noisy Crowdsourcing Annotations](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.200) (Zhang et al., ACL 2022)

The Chinese opinion expression identification dataset with expert and crowdsourcing annotations is constructed from covid-19 Weibo texts.

We will refine the labels in future!

The orginal code that used in experiments is avaliable at [ACL Anthology Software](https://aclanthology.org/attachments/2022.acl-long.200.software.zip).
